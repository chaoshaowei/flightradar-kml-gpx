To automatically pinpoint FR24 Hex ID, from given datetime
    If no database exists, finds 10000000, 11B63080, 1CC20400, 20000000, 30000000
    After database initialization, use continuous interpolation to find Hex ID, until delta is small (1 sec?)
        Inner interpolation: straight forward, if error, sequence one by one until found
        Outer interpolation: If error, sequence jump closer to known point by half a time

To find within a period of time (first trackpoint with timestamp), is there a aircraft reg match
    (eg. BLOCK_OUT-5min ~to~ TAKEOFF+5min)
    Pinpoint start/end hex id, then start sequence 1 by 1
